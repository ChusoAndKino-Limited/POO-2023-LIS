##Summary

This meeting mainly focused on the presentation of potential platforms for publishing project examples, accompanied by a sample of initial examples suitable for integration into the project.

##Details

The team explored two viable options for displaying examples. One option proposed was the development of a specific website with a blog-type format, which would provide an easy-to-use interface. The other option was a repository on GitHub.
Additionally, as part of the progress update, two of the five minimum required examples were shown. Each example was carefully chosen to align with the project objectives and provide valuable information.

## Discussion Highlights

1. **Publishing platforms:**
      - The team presented and discussed the advantages of a website versus a repository for publishing examples.

2. **Example of presentation:**
      - Showed two initial examples that showed the practical application of the project concepts.
      - Emphasized the importance of quality, relevance and diversity in the examples.

3. **Platform Selection:**
      - After extensive discussion, the team reached a consensus on using a GitHub repository to publish project examples.
      - I highlighted GitHub's robust tools for content monitoring and collaborative development.

## Conclusion

At the conclusion of the meeting, a final decision was made in favor of establishing a GitHub repository as the main platform for the project. The decision was based on the repository's efficient content management tools and collaboration features. Furthermore, the examples presented were approved, marking a positive step forward.

##Action Items
