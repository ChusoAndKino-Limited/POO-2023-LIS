## Resumen

On this occasion, we discussed organizational topics such as repository structure, and we changed from an individual repository to an organizational repository. Let's see how this last change will help us with the organization of the team.

## Details

First of all, we discussed how the repository will be organized, the elemental structure, how documentation will be organized, how to name the folders, and how the workflow will be, for example We made our first contact with protected branches, and with this, we set that every individual change would be committed in individual branches, and once the changes would be committed, we should make a pull request to the First-Submission branch, and when all tasks and issues related to "First Submission" were finalized, then First-Submission will merge with the main branch.

When we were discussing the above topic, we encountered the problem that only the owner of the repository can establish protected branches. This is obviously true, but what if we need at least two administrators? Then this is a problem. That's why we concluded that we should make an organization where there would be roles such as members, administrators, maintainers, etc., each with very defined repository permissions. So we called our organization:

## Conslusion

We set the elemental structure of the repository and workflow, and we made an organization where there could be at least two administrators (and no more) in the repository.
