## Resumen

In this meeting, the main focus of discussion was on the central idea of the project, taking into account all the proposals from each team member. The team discussed them and drew conclusions.

## Details

  
During the meeting, all the proposed ideas for the project that the team collected were presented. We had a total of about 7 options to discuss. Over the course of the meeting, we eliminated some options, and as a result of the meeting, we ended up with two main proposals that seemed more interesting to develop and address. Following the meeting, the team is now in discussion to decide which of the two proposals we will work with.

Additionally, informally, the team began to discuss what could be the use cases and a list of requirements for each of the ideas, clearly without delving into them deeply, but rather considering the most general and primary cases they could have. At the end of the meeting, the team gathered all that was discussed and outlined, and we began to allocate tasks.

## Conslusion

Two main ideas were selected from all the proposals, and likewise, we began to brainstorm possible use cases and requirements for the potential projects. We are now starting to work based on what was discussed in the meeting.
