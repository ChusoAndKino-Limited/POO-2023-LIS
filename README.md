### Product

#### Resume

<details>

At the beginning, in the second installment, we had outlined a very cautious path of what the development of the product would be like, including defining what the product we would be developing would be, whether it were a web, app, or something else, however after the mentoring with the professor, it was noted that the important thing about the project was the examples of the design patterns, and not so much the implementation, of course the implementation is essential for the presentation of the video, so it should be something quick, in In that sense, after investigating methods and technologies, it was concluded that the Astro framework would be ideal for this task, since Astro could render markdown files as HTML content, which makes the process of creating the examples much easier.

We forgot to create a CRUD, since the examples themselves would reside in the Github repository, opening the door for anyone to contribute either with feedback, or even add an example to the catalog.

## Requirements

### Functionals

- **Design pattern in software:** Our repository will contain and display coherent and appropriate information on software design patterns, and their application examples in real systems.

### No functionals

- **Implementation Examples:** In each design pattern example, the software code must be shown with specific examples (observations and comments) that show the application of said pattern in situations relevant to the project.

- **Interaction between Patterns:** If possible, it should be demonstrated how the different design patterns interact with each other in the software to achieve a coherent and efficient design.

- **Detailed Documentation:** Each design pattern shown must be accompanied by detailed technical documentation that explains its use, advantages, disadvantages and how it is integrated into the overall project.

For this second delivery it was decided to eliminate several requirements, the non-functional ones were more affected, related to the availability and usability of the system, they did not make sense in the current context of our project, since a repository will be used for the publication of our examples of code.
