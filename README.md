## Requirements

- NodeJS 18.17.1

## Set Up

Once you have cloned the repository, go to the First-Submission branch and execute the following command:

```console
npm install
```

This will download all dependencies of the project, such as Husky in order to validate commits.
> At this point, Husky and Commitlint are the only dependencies of the project because there is only documentation at the moment and there is no technology selected.
