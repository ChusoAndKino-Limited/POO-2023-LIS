# Process management

We coud distintc three main tools in the process mangement:

- Discord
- Github Projects
- Issues and Pull Requests

This started as a personal repository, but then we needed more than one administrator. That's why we created an organization so we could also manage well-defined roles in the repository with their respective privileges.

**Discord** was the quintessential tool for communication, most of the meeting were carried out there and at the final of every meeting we assigned a person who will write the meeting log.

As a tool of tracking, we used **Github Projects**, where we could see the backlog with Kanban view (status) and Roadmap view (sprints). This worked very well because we used **issues**, where each issue was manipulated as one task or a group of tasks (with their respective subtasks), and we also used the term **Milestone**, which is a collection of tasks that share the same objective. We defined our milestone as "First Submission", but this could change in the future. For this time, it worked greatly because it provided a progress bar of tasks completed related to the first submission.

**Protected branches** gave us the capacity to validate the contribution to the first-submission branch and, posteriorly, to the main branch. So the rule was simple: a contributor could only merge their work into the first-submission branch through a **Pull Request**, and this Pull Request must be approved at least by one person (in the beginning, it was two).

Using issues gave us the capacity to link them with their respective pull requests, so we could see what changes a person made in relation to the issue they were working on.

Finally, in the Scrum framework, the tasks should be completed over the course of the sprint, and tasks that weren't completed were passed on to the next sprint.
