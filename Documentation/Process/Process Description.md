# Process Description

We can describe the first submission in 3 well-defined phases:

1. Ideas Phase
	1.1 Repository Structure
2. Research Phase
3. Artifacts Phase

In the first one, the main goal was to obtain approval for the project idea, in parallel to this, we also set up the repository structure, where we touched out protected branches and workflow and we tried to use tools that could foment good practices with commits. 

In the second one, the goal was to go deeper into the idea with the most potential which in this case was *"Real uses of Design Patterns"*. At this point, the **team roles** were defined, but not static, we take as reference the **Scrum Framework**:

- **Product Owner:** Isaías Rodríguez, Marco Canché.
- **Scrum Master:** Rodrigo Pacab, Marco Canché.
- **Develpment Team:** José Luis Gutiérrez, Carlos Ruz.

> As we can see, one person could take more than one role, that's what we say "not static".

As scrum uses sprints, all the tasks were grouped by sprints, and tasks that weren't complete, were passed to the next sprint. **Each sprint took a long of 1 week**.
> You can take a look at our Github Project roadmap view.

Once we had enough information about the topic of the project, all that remained in the last phase was to start creating artifacts: requirements, use cases/user stories, use case diagrams, etc.

Documentation was done for all these phases, and meeting logs can be found in the repository.
