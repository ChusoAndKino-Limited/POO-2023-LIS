Throughout the course, we had the opportunity to collaborate in team, starting with the project we worked on, in addition to individual tasks. Over the semester, our team experienced ups and downs, but understanding the purpose of the course, we believe that we have developed and achieved both the generic and specific competencies of the subject through the project's development.

## Generic Competencies
As mentioned in the didactic planning, generic competencies involve non-specific skills of the career that we were supposed to acquire and demonstrate during the semester. These skills include communication, collaborative work, handling pressure, and applying the acquired knowledge. Undoubtedly, through the project work and the three deliveries, we have worked on and improved these aspects, ultimately acquiring the generic competencies.

## Specific Competencies
Regarding specific competencies, like the generic ones, we worked on them throughout the semester, not only through the project but also in tasks and various exams. Speaking specifically about the project, we addressed the different requirements of each delivery, consistently applying the object-oriented paradigm. We delved into topics such as inheritance, classes, objects, composition, and aggregation. Additionally, we explored various models and approaches in researching different design patterns, such as MVC. Therefore, we believe we have obtained the specific competencies.
