 **Implementation Examples:** In each design pattern example, the software code must be shown with specific examples (observations and comments) that show the application of said pattern in situations relevant to the project.

**Interaction between Patterns:** If possible, it should be demonstrated how the different design patterns interact with each other in the software to achieve a coherent and efficient design.

 **Detailed Documentation:** Each design pattern shown must be accompanied by detailed technical documentation that explains its use, advantages, disadvantages and how it is integrated into the overall project.

**Compliance with Coding Standards:** The code that implements the design patterns must follow the coding standards (ours) defined for the acceptance of the project code.

## _**Non-functional requirements**_

**Usability:** The system must work on different platforms

**Availability:** The software must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
