# _**Evoulution of Requirements**_

<hr>

## How did they change?

In this latest delivery, the requirements underwent no major changes; the ones presented in the second delivery were maintained, along with the addition of a new requirement aimed at providing a general understanding of each example. This involves incorporating basic information to grasp the context of the application of each pattern.


## Functionals
 **Design pattern in software:** Our repository will contain and display coherent and appropriate information on software design patterns, and their application examples in real systems.

## No functionals
 **Implementation Examples:** In each design pattern example, the software code must be shown with specific examples (observations and comments) that show the application of said pattern in situations relevant to the project.

**Interaction between Patterns:** If possible, it should be demonstrated how the different design patterns interact with each other in the software to achieve a coherent and efficient design.

 **Detailed Documentation:** Each design pattern shown must be accompanied by detailed technical documentation that explains its use, advantages, disadvantages and how it is integrated into the overall project.

 **Basic information:** Basic information is provided on the technologies used in the implementation examples of each pattern, aiming to enhance understanding of how each pattern interacts with its system environment.
