# _**Evolution of prioritazion of requirements**_

---

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Design Pattern Information:**
   - **Explanation:** This is prioritized as a must-have functional requirement since the repository's primary purpose is to provide comprehensive and relevant information on various software design patterns.
   - **Reasoning:** Understanding design patterns is fundamental to the project's goals, ensuring a solid foundation for users to grasp and apply these concepts.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

2. **Implementation Examples:**
   - **Explanation:** Given its direct impact on showcasing practical applications, this is considered a high-priority non-functional requirement.
   - **Reasoning:** The inclusion of specific examples with code, observations, and comments enhances the educational value of the repository, making it more practical and applicable for users.

3. **Basic Technology Information:**

- **Explanation:** Ranked second in priority among non-functional requirements due to its crucial role in enhancing users' comprehension of design pattern implementations.
- **Reasoning:** Providing basic information on technologies used in the examples ensures users have a solid foundation for understanding the practical application of each pattern.

4. **Detailed Documentation:**
   - **Explanation:** This requirement is crucial for providing in-depth understanding and context for each design pattern.
   - **Reasoning:** Comprehensive documentation is key to delivering value to users by explaining the usage, advantages, disadvantages, and integration aspects of each design pattern.

5. **Interaction between Patterns:**
   - **Explanation:** While desirable, this requirement is considered slightly lower in priority compared to others.
   - **Reasoning:** While showcasing interactions between design patterns is beneficial, it may be dependent on the complexity of patterns chosen. Therefore, it's important but not critical for the initial release.
