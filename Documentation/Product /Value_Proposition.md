# Value Proposition

The product stands out in that, unlike other tools found on the web about Design Patterns, it showcases examples of design patterns implemented in real code, as opposed to pages and books on Design Patterns that often feature fictional or gaming-related examples. Therefore, the product will provide users with information and examples that are indeed implemented in real life for better understanding and abstraction.
