We, as a team, believe that working on the project has allowed us to develop generic competencies. Collaborative work has led us to improve in areas such as communication, collaboration in various environments, problem-solving, and other contexts that are beneficial for our future careers as engineers, with a greater focus on soft skills.


### Specific Competencies

Regarding specific competencies, while working on the course based on the project, we have applied our previous knowledge as well as what we have learned in the course itself, such as requirements, use cases, monitoring tools, the object-oriented programming paradigm seen in the class diagram, class abstraction, and more. This indicates that we are acquiring the specific competencies required for this project.
