## Resumen

In the September 25 meeting we tried to make functional and non-functional requirements, but we ended up redefining where the project is going.

## Details

We started the meeting by brainstorming requirements about the project and slowly realized that each of us had a different perspective on it. For this reason we put aside the requirements and define the project route. In the end we came to the conclusion that we would explain some software design patterns with real examples and applications.

## Conslusion

We established the path of the project and prepared to present the project to the teacher.
