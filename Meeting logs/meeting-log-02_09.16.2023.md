# Meeting Log #2: About the repository

> September 16th, 2023

## Resumen

The objective of this meeting was to discuss issues about the repository, a standard was set for the structure of commit messages and problems related to pull requests were fixed.

## Details

We chose two tools to ensure that commit messages are written appropriately.

The first was a Visual Studio Code extension called "Conventional Commits". This extension helps you to fill in commit message according to Conventional Commits.

The second is Commitlint is a simple tool that lints your commit messages and makes sure they follow a set of rules. 
It runs as a husky pre-commit hook, that is, it runs before the code is committed and blocks the commit in case it fails the lint checks.

## Conclusion

Finally, we agreed that Rodrigo Pacab and I (Isaías Rodríguez) would be in charge of reviewing the pull requests, we also agreed that there would be a person assigned to each request.
