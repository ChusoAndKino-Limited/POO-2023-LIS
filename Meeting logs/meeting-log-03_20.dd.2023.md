# Meeting Log #3

September 20th, 2023

## Resumen

The objective of this meeting was to discuss if we are going to encompass the different types of design patterns that exist in the project or if we are going to focus on a specific one.

## Details

We discussed the idea of focusing on a specific design pattern due to the limited time we have for the project. It was mentioned that there is a wealth of information on this topic due to the implementation of these patterns in numerous projects available on the internet. It was clarified that one won't typically find a specific example of a pattern in a project due to the abstraction these patterns often entail. It was explained that projects do not conform to design patterns per se; in other words, projects are not created with the intention of applying a specific design pattern. Instead, it is identified that a particular pattern can be used to address a specific problem within the project.

## Conclusion

Finally, we reached the conclusion that the next project objective is to research various types of projects, frameworks, and applications where the implementation of these patterns can be observed, in order to present them as examples. All of this is because searching for a specific type of pattern is a very challenging task.
In addition to this, we discussed adding an additional component, which would involve identifying which SOLID principles each pattern is utilizing.
